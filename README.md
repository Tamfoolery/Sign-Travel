# Sign Travel
A fast travel / map mod inspired by the system in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt

Each signpost can be named

Signposts will automatically show signs pointing to the 4 nearest other signposts.

Left clicking on the signpost will bring up a map showing the locations of all the other sign posts. Clicking on a signpost location will prompt a "Fast travel to this location" dialog box. Clicking "Yes" will teleport the player to that signposts location.

Shift-left clicking on a signpost will bring up a GUI allowing the player to change that signposts name. On servers they will also have the option to make it so other players can change the name. By default only the player that placed the sign can change the name.
